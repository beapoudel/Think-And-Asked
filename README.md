The `QuestionAnswerContract` is designed to create a decentralized Q&A platform where students can ask questions and teachers can provide answers in exchange for a fee. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract ensures transparency, immutability, and direct financial transactions without intermediaries.

## Flowchart

1. **Student asks a question**:
   - Student submits a question along with a fee using `askQuestion`.
   - The question is stored in the `studentQuestions` mapping.
   - A `QuestionAsked` event is emitted.

2. **Teacher provides an answer**:
   - Teacher answers a question using `answerQuestion`.
   - The answer is stored in the `teacherAnswers` mapping.
   - The fee is transferred from the student's balance to the teacher.
   - A `QuestionAnswered` event is emitted.
