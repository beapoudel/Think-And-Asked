# Think-And-Asked
# QuestionAnswerContract

## Vision

The `QuestionAnswerContract` is designed to create a decentralized Q&A platform where students can ask questions and teachers can provide answers in exchange for a fee. By leveraging blockchain technology, this contract ensures transparency, immutability, and direct financial transactions without intermediaries.

## Flowchart

1. **Student asks a question**:
   - Student submits a question along with a fee using `askQuestion`.
   - The question is stored in the `studentQuestions` mapping.
   - A `QuestionAsked` event is emitted.

2. **Teacher provides an answer**:
   - Teacher answers a question using `answerQuestion`.
   - The answer is stored in the `teacherAnswers` mapping.
   - The fee is transferred from the student's balance to the teacher.
   - A `QuestionAnswered` event is emitted.

## Contract Address

The smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. The current deployment address is:

`0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678`

Please ensure to verify this address on the Ethereum network before interacting with the contract.

## Future Scope

- **Multi-Currency Support**: Implement support for multiple cryptocurrencies or stablecoins.
- **Reputation System**: Introduce a reputation system for both students and teachers to enhance trust.
- **Question Expiry**: Add functionality to handle question expiry or automatic refunds if not answered in a timely manner.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Integrate analytics to track the most popular topics and questions.
- **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface for easier interaction with the contract.
